/**
 * You are required to validate a math equation of the form "a operator b = c", you may use the function of basicMath.js
 * Things to point out: valid operators: "+"/"-"/"*"/"/"
 * Usage of floating numbers should be possible, for example "1.1+2=3.1" but you need to pay attention to the location of the dot,
 * for example equations of such as "1.0.0+3=4" or "1..0+2=3" are invalid, although ".5+1=1.5" and "10.+3=13" should be valid
